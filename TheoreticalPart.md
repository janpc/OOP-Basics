# Theorical Part

Now you have to investigate the paradigm of object-oriented programming in general terms. This research aims to clarify the following concepts:


## What is object-oriented programming in general terms?

Is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that contain data in the form of attributes or properties  and code in the form of methods. 


## What is a class?

The definitions for the data format and available methods for a given type of object.


## What is an object?

Instance of a class that has his own data.


## What is an instance?

Can be used to describe the relation between object and class or to refer to an object. 


## What is a property?

Variables that can store information inside a class.


## What is a method?

Procedures that can take input, and manipulate data, can generate output.


## What is the difference between a function and a method?

Both are pieces of code that are called by name and operate with data that is given as parameters. The difference is that the method is declared in a class and depends on it or on any of its instances. 


## What is a constructor?

Is a method of any class that creates an instance of this class and can receive arguments to define its properties.


## What is the difference between a class, an object and an instance?

A class is the definition of the properties and methods, an object is a particular case of a class and an instance can make reference to the object or to the relation between the class and the object.


## What do we understand by the concept of encapsulation?

Encapsulation is a concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.


## What do we understand by the concept of abstraction?

You can define an abstract class but you won’t be able to instance this class.  This is because abstract classes can only be inherited. Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity.


## What do we understand by the concept of inheritance?

It is a mechanism where you can derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.


## What do we understand by the concept of polymorphism?

It describes the concept that objects of different types can be accessed through the same interface.


## What do we understand by the concept of Overload?

Overloading a method simply means two or more methods have the same method name with different arguments or parameters and return type (not necessary).


## What do we understand by the concept of Override?

Overriding a method simply means that a subclass redefines its inherited method when it needs to change or extend the behavior of that method


## What differences exist between the concept of Overload and Override?

Overload creates two or more methods with the same name and override redefines a method in a subclass.


## What is a static class?

Static classes are classes that can’t be instanced and you can use the methods and properties without instancing.


## Look for 3 advantages over object-oriented programming compared to other programming paradigms

### Re-usability:

You can use the objects as many times as you want.

### Easy code:

The code is easier to read and understand.

### High abstraction:

Is focused on the functionalities, not in the code.


## Look for disadvantages of this paradigm.

<ul>

<li>Steep learning curve.</li>

<li>Larger program size.</li>

<li>Slower programs.</li>

<li>Not suitable for all types of problems.</li>

</ul>
